# goldman_sachs_aug2020

Java code to invert a given decimal number after padding it to the closest upper multiple of 8.

v1 - Code using Java built-in binarystring function to convert to binary and back to Integer.
v2 - Custom function to convert decimal number to binary string and invert the number

ex: 10 is represented as 1010 in binary and 00001010 in binary with padding to 8bit. 
Inverting this number 00001010 is 01010000 which is 80 in decimal.

to test use the following commands.

compile: javac goldmanQ2_2.java

run java main num1 num2 num3      (inputs are num1, num2, num3 can be any number of inputs)
